# KEY INSIGHTS
- •	The genres “Games” and “Entertainments” have large number of apps. So, entering these genres may be of high competition and must try to stand out.
- •	The average rating is computed to be 3.52. So, a new app should target for rating greater than 3.5 to stand out.
- •	Paid Apps have higher ratings than the Free Apps. Free Apps have a rating of 3.37 whereas paid apps have 3.72 which is slightly larger than the Free Apps.]
- •	Many apps support multiple languages. However, the apps that supports less than 10 languages have lower ratings. However, the apps that supports more than 40 languages have lower ratings than apps that supports languages between 10 – 40 languages. The quantity of languages that are available does not actually matter. We must focus on the right languages for the app.
- •	The genre Catalogues have lowest rating of 2.1 followed by finance and then book. This implies that users are not satisfied. Hence these areas require serious considerations.  If we can create some apps with potential that can attract users, we may get better ratings in this category. However, the genre productivity, Music, Photo&Video have highest ratings hence giving more exposure and recommendations for apps based on these genres can be considered.
